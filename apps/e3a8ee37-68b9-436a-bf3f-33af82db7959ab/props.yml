prompt: Create a customer feedback management app called FeedbackHub with a blue and white professional design. Features: Dashboard with feedback summary cards (Total Feedback, This Week, Positive/Negative Ratio, Top Issues) showing counts and simple metrics. Feedback List displaying all customer feedback with star ratings, customer names, dates, and category tags (Bug Report, Feature Request, Complaint, Praise). Add Feedback form with inputs for customer name, rating dropdown (1-5 stars), category selection, and feedback text area. Analytics section showing simple charts for feedback trends by category and rating distribution. Feedback Detail view for reading full feedback and adding internal notes. CRITICAL INTERACTIONS: Users must be able to navigate between Dashboard, All Feedback, Add Feedback, and Analytics using tab buttons, submit new feedback through the form with validation, click feedback items to view full details, filter feedback by category and rating using dropdown filters, add internal notes to feedback entries, and see all metrics update immediately when new feedback is added. Include success messages when feedback is saved and basic form validation for required fields. Make all navigation tabs, feedback cards, rating displays, filter controls, and note-taking functionality fully functional with proper state management
